# The Thought Stream 🌊💭  
**A useful web-based tool I made that allows you to practice writing to someone and copy what you told them to paste elsewhere. Useful for visualizing yourself teaching someone or offering services to them. Allows you to internalize what you need to reiterate over or focus more on before you have the same talk with a real person.**
